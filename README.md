# PokeSalah

Turn-based creature fighting game. The game's concept is similar to Pokemon, where each player has creatures fighting for him against another player, which has his own creatures. Each player takes a turn and can only perform one action. The players can use their turn to improve the stats of their creature, or they can try to attack another creature. The game is relatively simple and intuitive. There are some random elements added to provide more diverse gameplay. 

It was my first ever project with Java that utilized OOP, and was done in concordance with the course COMP248 (final project).

I had a lot of fun building this game, and it truly introduced me to the basics of OOP. I learned more about OOP in COMP249 when I saw inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
